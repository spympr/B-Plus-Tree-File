# B-Tree-File
Implementation of functions, which manage files based on B+ Trees.

# Summary
In this project we use implemented functions of management with Block Files and we implement functions, which manage files with Hash Tables, some of those are HT_CreateIndex,HT_OpenIndex,HT_CloseFile,HÎ¤_InsertEntry,HT_DeleteEntry etc. With execution of code we can observe that all entries have been inserted and printed normally (in seperated buckets and blocks), then find an entry with specific id, delete it and finally re-find it (which is going to throw error).

# Execution 
You can check it out, only with successively executions:
- **bash script1.sh**
Check results of first queries.
- **bash script2.sh**
Check results of next queries.
- **bash script3.sh**
Clean what we have just created.
